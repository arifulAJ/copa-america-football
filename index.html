                <h1>Diego Maradona </h1>
                <p>Maradona was technically very, very good. His dribbling, vision and creativity, ball control, and
                    passing were all phenomenal. He was especially adept at luring multiple defenders to close him down,
                    only to burst past them out of the melee with a sudden burst of speed. He was able to lead Argentina
                    to the 1986 World Cup, and Napoli to the 1986/87 Serie A title.</p>

                <h1>Pelé</h1>
                <p>Now people usually say that , the time Pele played in the pitches were too bad , the referees very
                    lenient regarding fouls and tackles and also the defenders used nasty tackles summing it up as a
                    very difficult time for a talent like Pele or even Maradona to play in. My opinion is completely
                    opposite today the game is much much more competitive , defenders are very fit and they build their
                    body and diet particularly for defence</p>
